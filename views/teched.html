          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
          <h4>The product:</h4>
          <p>I are creating an app, as well as a responsive mobile, and desktop website that tutors adults who want to learn technical skills. They also want to offer a 
              collective for those who want to stay current on new advancements and new trends in the tech community.</p>

          <h3>Project duration:</h3>
          <p>January-Feburary 2023</p>

          <h3>The problem:</h3>
          <p>Adults who want to learn new skills in the technical field can be intimidated about where to get started and want a comfortable experience they can access in 
              their home or on the go, depending on their needs and lifestyle.</p>

          <h3>The goal:</h3>
          <p>To offer a pleasant and educational experience for users who want to learn at any time in any space and offer those who just want to stay current on new 
              advancements and trends in technology an all in one experience.</p>

          <h3>My role:</h3>
          <p>Lead UX designer, UX researcher</p>
          
          <h4>Responsibilities:</h4> 
          <p>User research, Wire-framing, Prototyping, Lead Designer</p>
          <p>An unmoderated usability study was conducted remotely on February 9th, 2023. We took a qualitative approach in our primary interviews. The results of those 
              interviews showed that users wanted an internal communication system and a way to save or like content, courses, and tutors to their profile as well as see 
              ratings and featured content. There were a few user flow and feature location issues that we needed to address. We conducted a usability study followed by a 
              Systems Usability Scale.</p>

          <p>Users want to be able to communicate with tutors and peers internally.</p>

          <h4>Icons/feature location</h4>
          <p>It was noted that certain features should be relocated and the menu icon changed to a settings icon which would be a better representation.</p>

            <p>Based on the competitive audit, I saw a need to create an easy experience that was warm and friendly. Putting an emphasis on being informative without being 
            overwhelming to new learners and making them feel comfortable became a priority.
            Including an available tutor profile page with information about the tutor would offer a more personalized experience. If the user felt they knew the tutor 
            they were booking it could eliminate any apprehension the learner may have and allow them to focus on learning.
            Simplified navigation offers a clean homepage and information the user may not necessarily need right away can be found there when needed.

              Bookmarks were added for users to save favorite tutors to their user profile. I’m ideating an

              Offering an easy and comfortable experience we chose to include words of encouragement on the homepage 
              as well as images of people to make for a more welcoming experience. You can see we changed the menu icon to a settings icon to more appropriately 
              reflect its contents, as well as rearranged the icons.

              Adding bookmarks to the tutor profile page would allow learners to read about the tutor before bookmarking 
              for future use. Also pre-recorded courses by that tutor can be bookmarked for later viewing.  I also added an “Add to Calendar” option in the booking 
              confirmation modul for convenience.
