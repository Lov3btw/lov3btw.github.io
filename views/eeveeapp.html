            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Eevee Umbreon is a jewelry designer that is in need of an app to showcase their designs. It needs to offer an enjoyable shopping experience for all 
              users whenever and wherever they choose to shop. Client wants the users to feel secure and confident from the second they open the app to completing and 
              receiving a purchase.</p>

            <h5>Project duration:</h5>
            <p>October 2022 (4 weeks)</p>

            <h5>The problem:</h5>
            <p>The client requested an app to ensure a pleasant shopping experience that would set them apart from their competitors.</p>

            <h5>The goal:</h5>
            <p>A pleasant shopping experience that is accessible to all users and offers a secure process to everyone who might be skeptical of purchasing luxury goods online.</p>

            <h5>My role:</h5>
            <p>Lead UX designer, UX researcher</p>
            
            <h5>Responsibilities:</h5> 
            <p>User research, Wire-framing, Prototyping</p>
            <p>An unmoderated usability study was conducted remotely on October 12th. I took a qualitative approach in my primary interviews. 
              The results of those interviews revealed that accessibility and security were important issues among users, as well as a simple checkout process. 
              I conducted a usability study followed up with a Systems Usability Scale. A second Usability Study identified a few features that the prototype was lacking.</p>

            <h2>User Pain Points</h2>
            <h5>Accessibility icon</h5>
            <p>The study found that not all users recognized the accessibility icon or knew what the term meant.</p>

            <h5>User flow check-out process</h5>
            <p>Most users in our study either struggled with the check-out process or did not complete the task of completing an order.</p>

            <h5>Menu and its contents</h5>
            <p>All users in the study expressed confusion with the menu. We determined that moving accessibiltiy to the menu and simplifying the menu content would be benficial.</p>

            <h5>Back Navigation</h5>
            <p>I had no clear indication of how to navigate backwards in the user flow. The remedy was a back arrow on all appropriate screens.</p>

            beneficial to users and moving it into the menu is more familiar.</p>

            <p>After the usability study I decided to utilize gesture navigation to move backwards within the app.</p>
            <p>Before our study we had a three screen checkout process. This process starts when you select the "Proceed to Checkout" option. 
            There were two screens before you chose to "Review your Order. I found that this was unnecessarily tedious for users and simplifying the process was needed.</p>

            <p>As you saw on the previous page the user flow to complete the checkout process was lenghy. We simplified it to a scroll down and consolidated the personal information

          <p>Going into this project I often found that I was overthinking everything from content to design. With advice from peers and independent research I was able to integrate
          design elements and features I had initially overlooked, thus improving the visual design and functionality of the app.</p>

            <p>My takeaways from this project is the importance of following the design process. Especially in the wireframing and low-fidelity protoyping phase. A culmination of
              research, usability study, competitive audit and asking myself what I look for in an app of this nature really helped me expand on the initial direction of the desgin.</p>
            <p>Users want to be able to be kept as up to date as possible on thier order status. My next step for the app would be iterating the design and funcitonality of this feature.
