              <h1>User Pain Points</h1>
              <h4>No way to save items for later</h4>
              <p>All users mentioned they often save items for later or delete them from the cart or “liking” items for comparison and/or future consideration.</p>
  
              <h4>Return to Homepage</h4>
              <p>While most users knew to click the websites logo to return home some did not.</p>
  
              <h4>Card spacing on the Homepage </h4>
              <p>All users in the study expressed confusion with the menu. We determined that moving accessibiltiy to the menu and simplifying the menu content would be benficial.</p>
  
              <h4>Icons</h4>
              <p>It was noted by some users that the icons came across as harsh and unbalanced.</p>

              I made two size variations as you can see. My client wanted users to easily shop anywhere they were, on 
              whatever device they might be using, with however much time they may have to browse. The only difference in the size variations is we removed some of the 
              icons from the navigation bar. All those features and settings can be found under the menu.

          <p>For the High fidelity prototype we added the "saved" items screen and implemented the change to the menu and its features as well as removing icons from the homepage.
            I added the "Buy Now" option and added a quantity drop box.</p>
            <p>Prototyping the hi-fi mock-up revealed a crucial design flaw that we were able to quickly rectify, which was the absence of an actual bag screen instead 
            of utilizing just the bag module.</p>

          <h1>Takeaways</h1>
          <h4>Impact:</h4>
          <p>“I think it looks well designed and polished with a nice theme.”-Brad W.</p>

          <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
          <p>Going into this project I often found that I was overthinking everything from content to design. With advice from peers and independent research I was able to integrate design
            elements and features I had initially overlooked. Thus improving the visual design and functionality of the app.</p>
